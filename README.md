# A serverless traffic_incident web application and API built with Cloud Functions

The application is a simple traffic_incident website. It demonstrates how to build a serverless web application where static content is hosted in a storage bucket (here it uses GitHub Pages) and the backend is implemented with Cloud Functions. API Gateway is used to expose the Cloud Functions for the web user interface.

This Project is done with the reference to the guessbook tutorial offered by IBM Cloud.
